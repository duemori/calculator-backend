# User

This API was created to manage users and work as an authentication server.

Created using Java 17, Spring Boot 2.7.7, JPA and MySQL. Talking about tests, used JUnit, Mockito, DataJpaTest and H2.

**Important:** The development is not finished. Expectation was to implement an authentication server using JWT and integrate with calculator-api.
